# Recall_analysis

Auto manufacturers that determine a vehicle has a safety defect will conduct a recall campaign. During a recall all vehicle owners will be notified there is a problem and are asked to contact their auto dealership to schedule vehicle service to correct or resolve the safety concern.

When recalls affect a large number of vehicles, day-to-day business at the dealerships can be disrupted causing a drop in new vehicle sales, part sales or tire replacements. Understanding the frequency and size of recalls is important for any company working in the automotive industry.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a federal agency that requires auto manufacturers to notify the public when a significant safety concern is identified. The information is available in data tables stored on the website for NHTSAâ€™s Office of Defects Investigation.

In this project, I imported data from the NHTSA web site and analyzed the recall trend for different manufacturers. Moreover,according to the recall frequency and size, I grouped the manufacturers using hierarchical clustering.
